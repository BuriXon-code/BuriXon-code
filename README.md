## whoami
I am a beginner hobbyist programmer from Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±

I primarily write Linux shell scripts; I am also learning PHP. I write scripts that are simple tools or games for Termux and Linux environments (mainly Termux).

Most of my scripts work in Polish, but over time English equivalents will also be created.

I'm currently working on a Sudoku game and Facebook Messenger for Linux terminal and Termux. It's tough, so I won't say exactly when they'll be done.

For now, I invite you to familiarize yourself with ready-made scripts and tools :)
