# Hello!

### whoami

I'm a beginner programmer from Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± who wants to show off my skills here.

At the moment I am writing Linux shell scripts and gently delving into PHP.

### Main assumptions:

I code primarily in and for Termux. There may also be scripts that work in other environments.

I don't bother with hacking. I'd rather write a simple game or a small tool.

I don't work professionally with Linux or even computers, so bear with me. I've only been on the subject since February 2024. I learn very quickly, so I will try to share my hobby with You.

### What's next?

I don't know. We'll find out when I write something :)

I am currently working on a Sudoku game and Facebook Messenger for Termux/Linux terminal. This is actually very difficult. I will need a lot of time for this.

In the meantime, I will share my current scripts with you.
